  <h1><b>Harassment and bullying online is a red flag for abuse in the real world</b></h1>

  <p>Not only did students report high rates of cyber bullying and dating abuse, they also reported physical, emotional, and sexual abuse offline and in person.
      Ninety percent of cyber bullying victims have also been psychologically abused, and two-thirds to three-quarters have been physically abused.
      Dating teens who were digitally abused or harassed by their partners were 2 times as likely to be physically abused, 2.5 times as likely to be psychologically abused, and 5 times as likely to be coerced into having unwanted sex.
      Many cyber bullying victims have also been abused online or through texts sent by their partners. Victims of cyber bullying were almost 3 times as likely to have experienced digital dating abuse or harassment as well.
     Victims of both types of online harassment shared similar vulnerabilities, such as depression, and similar risk factors, such as frequent drinking and recent feelings of anger or hostility.
     A small group of youth, however, only experience bullying or dating abuse online, making it important to distinguish this form of harassment from other abuse and harassment in the real world.</p>

<h1><b>Teenage girls and LGBTQ youth are particularly vulnerable</b></h1>
  <p>Twice as many teenage girls than boys reported sexual abuse online and through texts. Teenage girls were also more likely to be victims of cyber bullying than teenage boys.
     Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth reported much higher rates of digital dating abuse and cyber bullying than heterosexual youth. Just over one-third of LGBTQ youth said a partner had abused or harassed them online or through texts. A quarter were victims of cyber bullying.Gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) adolescents face the same developmental tasks as their heterosexual peers. They also face additional challenges that may negatively affect their development - such as the need to develop an identity with few role models - that are different from their peers. But we live in changing times. Openly gay people are prominent in diverse fields - business, finance, entertainment, sports, science. Family-oriented television shows feature gay characters and themes. The Internet offers a new world. The prospects for GLB youth today are more promising than ever before.

But not everything has changed. Despite progress, GLB youth must still cope with a culture that is often hostile. Stigma still surrounds homosexuality. GLB kids face many of the same obstacles as earlier generations: poor self-esteem, family rejection, stigma, social isolation, self-harm, and risky behavior. In school, where kids should feel safe, GLB youth are often taunted and bullied. In many cases, a kid will not seek help, suffering in silence, due to shame. As these social stressors accumulate, GLB adolescents have a greater risk for mental and physical health complications, compared with their peers.</p>

<h1> <b>Victims rarely seek help</b></h1>

<p> Less than one in ten victims of digital dating abuse and only one in six cyber bullying victims sought help. In total, twice as many young women sought help than did young men. Very few boys reach out to someone for help.Parents, teachers, and others can help GLB kids negotiate the challenging passage through adolescence into healthy adulthood by showing support, helping reduce social isolation and promoting coping skills. The term "resilience" is used to describe the healthy ability to adapt to adversity and bounce back. Most GLB youth are naturally resilient and, over time, develop coping skills and a positive self-identity. But some are more vulnerable and may need help.Approximately one in four families has an immediate GLB family member. Studies suggest that 2 to 4.5% of high school youth self-identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual; these figures do not reflect others who may be struggling with coming to an understanding of their sexual orientation. Many myths surround homosexuality. Here are a few facts. </p>

<h1> <b>How educators, parents, advocates, and teens can help</b></h1>
<p> The same digital platforms abusers and bullies exploit for harassment can also be tools to prevent abuse. Victim advocates can use social media, text messaging, and email to educate teens, spread the word about where to go for help, and give victims and witnesses a safe way to report abuse. Parents, educators, and peer leaders should raise awareness about the behavior that counts as abuse, harassment, and bullying and the importance of seeking help.

School faculty and staff should be trained to identify digital dating abuse and cyber bullying and should take protective measures to discourage online abuse in school computer labs. Because victims are more likely to go to friends for help or advice, schools might create peer groups to offer victims a comfortable place to report incidents.</p>
